# Advent of Code 2021
## What is it?

The Advent of Code is a programming event that happens during Advent. Each day a new puzzle (that is actually comprised of two puzzles) is released, and they progress in difficulty quite considerably.

This event is known to be extremely difficult and most programmers give up on the 4th or 5th day.
